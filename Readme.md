# Movie Rating Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about movies, including their genres, release year, and other relevant attributes. It is then deployed using a web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input movie attributes and receive predicted ratings.

## Features

- **Data**: The dataset consists of `[insert number]` movies with `[insert number]` features, including:
  - Genre
  - Number of Genres
  - Release Year
  - Number of Votes

- **Model**: Different machine learning models were trained on the dataset to predict movie ratings.
  - Models tested: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, XGBoost Regressor, etc.

- **Pickle File**: A serialized version of the trained model is saved in a pickle file, allowing for efficient deployment.

- **Streamlit App**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit to interact with the model, input movie attributes, and receive predicted ratings.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- Streamlit
- Pickle

## Model Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming raw data into meaningful inputs.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scaling numerical features for improved model performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Features**: Converting categorical data into numerical format for model compatibility.

### 2. Model Selection
- Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Gradient Boosting Regression
  - XGBoost Regressor

### 3. Model Training
- **Data Split**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Training**: Training the selected model(s) on the training set.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to assess model performance on the testing set.

### 4. Handling Outliers
- **Capping**: Identifying and capping outliers in numerical features to reduce their impact on the model's accuracy.

## Deployment

To deploy the model and make it available on the web:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Push all the project files (code, model, etc.) to GitHub.
2. **Set up Cloud Platform Account**: Use platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS to deploy the application.
3. **Configure the Streamlit App**: Ensure that the app is correctly configured for cloud deployment.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
- Improve model accuracy.
- Add new features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Enhance the Streamlit web app to improve user experience.
